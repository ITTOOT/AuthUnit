Run the test using the Django test runner.
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory,
then run the following command:

    python manage.py test <app_name>

Replace <app_name> with the name of your Django app containing the tests

Create a new file with a .py extension and paste the test code into it.
For example, you can create a file named tests.py in the same directory as your Django app.

Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Django project.

Run the following command to execute the test:

    python manage.py test

This command will run all the tests in your Django project.

The test runner will discover and execute the tests defined in your tests.py file.
It will display the test results in the console.

If the test passes, you will see an output similar to:

    .
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 1 test in 0.001s

    OK

If the test fails, you will see detailed output indicating which assertions failed.

Create a tests directory within each app and place your test files inside it.
he test file should be named test*.py or *_test.py for the test runner to
discover and execute them automatically.
